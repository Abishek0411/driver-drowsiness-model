# driver-drowsiness-model
Requirement:
 1. Libraries and Frameworks: OpenCV: For computer vision tasks, including face 
detection, eye tracking, and image processing.
2. Hardware Requirements: A computer with a webcam or a compatible camera for realtime video input.
 3. Alerting Mechanism: Develop a mechanism to provide timely alerts to the driver when 
drowsiness is detected. This may include audio alarms, visual cues, or haptic feedback.
4.Mathematical Model:Develop a mathematical model using the Euclidean algorithm, or a 
modified version of it, to analyze driver behavior and eye movements to detect drowsiness.5. 
5. Real-Time Processing: Create code for real-time image or video processing to extract 
relevant features for input into the Euclidean algorithm-based model.Software Requirement
• Front End: PERCLOS Systems
• Technologies: Python
• Libraries: OpenCV, imutils, scipy, cmake, dlib, pygame
• Devices: Camera
